# Area & Volume Calculator



# How It Works

- First, it asks for the length and width of a rectangle and gives you the area.
- Then, you pick a shape (cube, cylinder, or sphere) to find its volume.
- It asks for the needed dimensions and gives you the result.
- If you enter something that isn't a valid input, it lets you know.
